Quality Control of NGS Data
===================

Learning Objectives:
-------------------
#### What's the goal for this lesson?

* Understand how the FastQ format encodes quality
* Be able to evaluate a FastQC report
* Use Trimmommatic to clean FastQ reads
* Use a For loop to automate operations on multiple files


## Details on the FASTQ format

Although it looks complicated  (and maybe it is), its easy to understand the [fastq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) format with a little decoding. Some rules about the format include...

|Line|Description|
|----|-----------|
|1|Always begins with '@' and then information about the read|
|2|The actual DNA sequence|
|3|Always begins with a '+' and sometimes the same info in line 1|
|4|Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores; must have same number of characters as line 2|

so for example in our data set, one complete read is:
```
$ head -n4 SRR098281.fastq 
@SRR098281.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:318 length=35
CNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
+SRR098281.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:318 length=35
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```
This is a pretty bad read. 

Notice that line 4 is:
```
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```
As mentioned above, line 4 is a encoding of the quality. In this case, the code is the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart) character table. According to the chart a '#' has the value 35 and '!' has the value 33. If only it were that simple. There are actually several historical differences in how Illumina and other players have encoded the scores. Heres the chart from wikipedia:

                           -5....0........9.............................40 
                                 0........9.............................40 
                                    3.....9.............................40 
  0.2......................26...31........41                              

 S - Sanger        Phred+33,  raw reads typically (0, 40)
 X - Solexa        Solexa+64, raw reads typically (-5, 40)
 I - Illumina 1.3+ Phred+64,  raw reads typically (0, 40)
 J - Illumina 1.5+ Phred+64,  raw reads typically (3, 40)
     with 0=unused, 1=unused, 2=Read Segment Quality Control Indicator (bold) 
     (Note: See discussion above).
 L - Illumina 1.8+ Phred+33,  raw reads typically (0, 41)
 ```
 So using the Illumina 1.8 encouding, which is what you will mostly see from now on, our first c is called with a Phred score of 0 and our Ns are called with a score of 2. Read quality is assessed using the Phred Quality Score.  This score is logarithmically based and the score values can be interpreted as follows:

|Phred Quality Score |Probability of incorrect base call |Base call accuracy|
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------:|-----------------:|
|10	|1 in 10 |	90%|
|20	|1 in 100|	99%|
|30	|1 in 1000|	99.9%|
|40	|1 in 10,000|	99.99%|
|50	|1 in 100,000|	99.999%|
|60	|1 in 1,000,000|	99.9999%|

## FastQC
FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) provides a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are
* Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
* Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
* Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
* Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
* Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application

## Exercise - Running FASTQC

### A. Stage your data

~move data from hidden into dc_workshop/data

### B. Run Fastqc 

run fastqc
move results to dc_workshop/results
look at summary.txt

### C. Document your work

cat all fastqc summary.txts into one full_report.txt and move this to ~/dc_workshop/docs


##How to clean reads using *Trimmomatic*
###A detailed explanation of features

Once we have an idea of the quality of our raw data, it is time to trim away adapters and filter out poor quality score reads. To accomplish this task we will use *Trimmomatic* (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic).

*Trimmomatic* is a java based program that can remove sequencer specific reads and nucleotides that fall below a certain threshold. *Trimmomatic* can be multithreaded to run quickly. 

Because *Trimmomatic* is java based, it is run using the command:

**_java jar trimmomatic-0.32.jar_**

What follows this are the specific commands that tells the program exactly how you want it to operate. *Trimmomatic* has a variety of options and parameters:

* **_-threds_** How many processors do you want *Trimmomatic* to run with?
* **_SE_** or **_PE_** Single End or Paired End reads?
* **_-phred33_** or **_-phred64_** Which quality score do your reads have?
* **_SLIDINGWINDOW_** Perform sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold.
* **_LEADING_** Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality.
* **_TRAILING_** Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality.
* **_CROP_** Cut the read to a specified length.
* **_HEADCROP_** Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read.
* **_MINLEN_** Drop an entire read if it is below a specified length.
* **_TOPHRED33_** Convert quality scores to Phred-33.
* **_TOPHRED64_** Convert quality scores to Phred-64.

A generic command for *Trimmomatic* looks like this:

**_java jar trimmomatic-0.32.jar SE -thr _**

A complete command for *Trimmomatic* will look something like this:

**_java jar trimmomatic-0.32.jar SE -threads 4 -phred64 SRR_0156.fastq SRR_1056_trimmed.fastq ILLUMINACLIP:SRR_adapters.fa SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 _**

This command tells *Trimmomatic* to run on a Single End file (``SRR_0156.fastq``, in this case), the output file will be called ``SRR_0156_trimmed.fastq``,  there is a file with Illumina adapters called ``SRR_adapters.fa``, and we are using a sliding window of size 4 that will remove those bases if their phred score is below 20.


## Exercise - Running Trimmomatic
